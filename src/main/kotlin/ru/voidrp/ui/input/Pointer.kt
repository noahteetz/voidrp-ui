/**
 * Where the pointer is drawn between two readings of the player's aim.
 *
 * A client reports where it is looking twenty times a second at best, and that is the
 * ceiling on *knowing* where the pointer should be — not on drawing it. The whole question
 * is what to draw in the four frames out of five that have no reading of their own.
 *
 * **It walks the distance at one pace, rather than pouncing on it.** A reading says the hand
 * is 98 units further along than it was 55 ms ago — the median of a real one, recorded with
 * `/vui debug trace` while a player moved the mouse fast and slow. What took the hand 55 ms
 * is drawn over 55 ms, so every frame of that gap is the same size and nothing steps. The
 * filter this replaces — a tracker correcting a fraction of its error per reading — put
 * **45% of a gap's whole movement into its first frame**, where an even walk puts 20%. That
 * is a pointer twitching five times a second, which is what it looked like, and no amount of
 * smoothing on top helped: smoothing hid the twitch by adding lag, and the twitch came back
 * the moment the lag came out.
 *
 * **The lead is a pace, not an offset.** The answer has half a round trip to make before it
 * is on the screen, so the walk aims to arrive that much early — which is the same thing as
 * being thrown forward, with one difference that turned out to be the other half of the
 * problem. An offset added to a position has to appear and disappear: the old one grew when
 * a reading landed and collapsed when the walk ran out of distance, thirty-two units, twenty
 * times a second, on top of everything else. Folded into the pace, it has nothing to
 * collapse.
 *
 * The rest follows:
 *
 *  * **A stop is silence.** A client sends nothing while the hand is still, so nothing
 *    announces a stop — but nothing has to. The walk aims at the last reading and arrives,
 *    and an arrived walk stands still on the aim itself. The tracker before it was clamped
 *    into a window around the reading and left at the edge of it, twelve units to one side
 *    for as long as the hand stayed still.
 *  * **The gap is measured, not assumed.** A tick is what the protocol says; a live client
 *    sent readings 44 to 99 ms apart.
 *  * **It carries a movement on, a little.** Walked evenly, the pointer is a whole reading
 *    behind the hand, and on a normal ping the lead already spends all the room the walk
 *    was given — so the only way closer is to aim past the last reading, by a share of how
 *    far that reading moved ([prediction]). Only while readings keep coming: the first one
 *    after a silence has no pace to carry on, and once a reading is late the hand has
 *    stopped and the pointer walks back onto the aim over one gap rather than snapping.
 *    At the default it is 36 ms behind a moving hand instead of 65, and passes a sudden
 *    stop by about 14 units at an ordinary pace.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about a player or a canvas: it is arithmetic, and it is tested as such,
 * against six invented hands and one recorded one.
