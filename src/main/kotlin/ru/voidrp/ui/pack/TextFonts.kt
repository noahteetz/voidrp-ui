/**
 * The site's own typeface, baked into the pack.
 *
 * Pages should look like the rest of VoidRP, and nothing gives a design away faster than
 * its lettering — so the interface is set in Inter, the face the website and the in-game
 * WebGUI already use, rather than Minecraft's pixel font. Inter is rendered here into
 * bitmap sheets at the sizes pages actually use, which keeps every letter crisp (the
 * client never has to scale one) and keeps the server and the client in perfect agreement
 * about how wide a word is.
 *
 * ### Why the widths matter so much
 *
 * A page is one line of text laid out by the client, and the server has to predict the pen
 * exactly or the page slides sideways. The client advances a bitmap glyph by the width of
 * its ink plus one pixel — not by the typographic advance, which also counts the air on
 * either side of a letter. Both numbers are measured here while the sheet is drawn, and
 * the encoder makes up the difference with spacer glyphs.
 *
 * Inter is used under the SIL Open Font License; see `font/Inter-OFL.txt` in the jar.
