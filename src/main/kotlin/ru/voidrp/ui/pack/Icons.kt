/**
 * Pictures of items and blocks, borrowed from the client's own textures.
 *
 * A shop, a quest list or an inventory screen is mostly pictures of items, and the client
 * already has every one of them. A bitmap glyph can point at any texture in the assets, so
 * the pack simply declares `minecraft:item/diamond.png` as a glyph and the client draws it
 * — the pack carries none of Mojang's artwork and grows by nothing but a list of names.
 *
 * The colour bits are still spent on the vertical position, so an icon is drawn white:
 * white leaves the texture exactly as it is, while everything else on the page is tinted.
 *
 * Blocks are included because a shop is mostly blocks, and a shop that cannot show stone
 * is not a shop. They are drawn flat — one face, not the little cube the inventory draws —
 * since a glyph is a picture and nothing here can turn a model into one. Which face is not
 * guessed from file names: ancient debris has no ancient_debris.png at all, only a side and
 * a top, and a glass pane's picture is the glass rather than the thin edge its own texture
 * shows. [faces] says, for every item where the name does not lead to the right picture,
 * the texture the client's own model puts on the face you see — and, for leaves, vines and
 * grass, the colour the client paints them, since in the texture they are grey.
