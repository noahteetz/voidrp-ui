/**
 * Builds the resource pack the client needs: our patched text shaders, the font whose
 * glyphs the pages are drawn with, and the textures behind them.
 *
 * The pack is generated rather than shipped as a file so it always matches the plugin,
 * and so a server owner never has to open a zip to change anything.
 *
 * ### Why two copies of the shader
 *
 * Mojang reorganised the shader files between 26.1.2 and 26.2: up to pack format 84 the
 * file is `rendertype_text.vsh` (GLSL 150), from 26.2 (format 88) it is `text.vsh`
 * (GLSL 330) with variants behind #define. Both are verified against the real client
 * jars. The base pack carries the old layout and an overlay carries the new one, which
 * is what overlays exist for — one pack, every supported version.
