/**

 *
 * A vanilla client has no mouse to lend us, so the cursor is the player's own aim: how far
 * they have turned since the page opened is where the pointer sits. The canvas is about
 * forty degrees across, so a small turn of the head reaches any corner of it.
 *
 * Everything else follows from that. Hovering is a rectangle test against the layout, so
 * the server always knows what the player is pointing at and the client is never asked.
 * A click is an ordinary swing or use packet, which is why this works on a client with
 * nothing installed.
