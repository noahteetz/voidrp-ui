 * What another plugin talks to.
 *
 * This is the whole surface: open a page for a player, close it, ask what they have open.
 * Everything else — how a page is written, what it may contain — lives in [Page] and the
 * layout, which any plugin can use directly.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val ui = VoidRpUi.get() ?: return   // VoidRpUI not installed
 * ui.open(player, MyShopPage())
 * ```
 *
 * The implementation registers itself with Bukkit's service manager, so nothing has to be
 * cast to our plugin class and nothing breaks when this plugin is reloaded underneath.
 * Depend on it softly (`softdepend: [VoidRpUI]` in plugin.yml) and check for null: a server
 * without the interface installed should lose the screens, not the plugin.
